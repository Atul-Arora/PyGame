Pygame sends a QUIT event into its event queue.

Your loop checks:

if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
    pygame.quit()


‚úÖ This line uninitializes Pygame (shuts down graphics, sound, etc.).

üëâ BUT the while True: loop is still running.
That means after quitting Pygame, the loop goes back around and runs pygame.display.update(), even though the window is already destroyed.
This can lead to errors like "pygame.error: display Surface quit"."""
